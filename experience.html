          I’m a student employee for the Web Strategy department at the
          University of Iowa College of Liberal Arts & Sciences Marketing and
          Communications team. When I started this role, I was involved in the
          college's website migration from Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 to help update
          the college’s brand image while upgrading the site to the current
          version of Drupal before support for Drupal 7 ended. Now that web
          migration is complete, I help maintain various department websites
          under the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences domain by creating web
          strategies and performing website maintenance.
